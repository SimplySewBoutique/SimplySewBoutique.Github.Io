<h2 style="text-align:center">About Us</h2>
<p>Welcome to Simply Sew Boutique. We are a small boutique located in Pittsburgh.  I am in my 17th year and plan on many more.  I have a wonderful husband who continues to support me daily along with my 17 year old boy/girl twins.  All 3 have been such an inspiration to my creativity! </p>

<p>Everything in my shop is handmade and designed my me, Janise the owner.  I have a wonderful staff of ladies who sew and make my visions/designs  come go life.  All my items are made in the US. I take great pride in hand picking materials and notions to make the best possible design.</p>

<p>I love working with my clients to make custom designs to make  your vision come alive. It’s so rewarding seeing your child’s smiling face in my creations.  It’s absolutely the most rewarding part of the job.</p>

<p>My speciality is both designing boys and girls clothing as well as extras such as totes and baby bibs, Easter baskets and custom mouse ears.  The sky is the limit and our possibilities are endless.</p>


<p>I am so blessed with all the long term friendship I have made over the years.  I was able to enjoy your children growing up and moving along in each phase of my designs.</p>

<p>I am so happy for all past and present folks this wonderful small business has blessed me with.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting us and we hope to see you again! <br>

-Janise Razum </p>
